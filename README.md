# stripePlaidFreshbooks
This is a mini app that uses plaid+stripe to get an invoice in freshbooks paid via ACH.

In all honestly, literally 2 days after I finished my first test with this Freshbooks announced their own solution for ACH (via wepay). So I may not actually be using this for Freshbooks - however, I think it serves as a good basis to understand how to integrate ACH with stripe and plaid.

I hope someone gets something out of this, I certainly enjoyed creating this.

No guarantee for this and no support - it's meant to be for learning solely.
